| Stephanie Hobson       | Web Accessibility: Making Websites Better For Everyone | Not everyone uses a keyboard, a monitor, and a mouse to access your sites on desktops. Not everyone uses a finger to interact with your sites on touch screens. When you consider these users while building your sites, the sites you build are easier for everyone to use. From attaching your events to the right elements and keeping your users in control, to including ARIA roles and following progressive enhancement - we'll look at a few things you can start and stop doing with JavaScript to make your sites better for everyone.                                                                                                                                                        | Accessibility | [Slides and links](http://stephaniehobson.ca/2015/10/27/still-making-websites-better-for-everyone/) |
